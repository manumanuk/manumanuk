### Hi, I'm Aryan. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo with an interest in embedded systems, full-stack development, and machine learning. Here's a list of some things I'm currently working on, as well as some of the projects I'm most proud of:

* [Sendable](https://bit.ly/SendableCS): Sendable is a web app designed to make privacy more accessible to everyone by simplifying PIPEDA requests for consumers. The site was created with Angular, Firebase Tools (Authentication, Cloud Functions, Realtime DB) and Google Drive API.
* [CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://bit.ly/CS50-AI): Over the quarantine lockdown, I spent my time learning Artificial Intelligence fundamentals at Harvard University's CS50 course on EdX. Check out the projects I completed for the course, from a crossword puzzle solver to an image classifier.
* [Computer Vision @ UWARG](https://github.com/UWARG/computer-vision-python): I'm currently working as a CV Developer at the University of Waterloo Aerial Robotics Group, helping create a vision system for an unmanned aerial vehicle that can detect and geolocate targets on ground in real-time. I've helped set up the YOLOV2 architecture, created a Chrome Extension to simplify data collection using Google Images, and play a part in leading the subteam.
* [My Portfolio](https://aryankalia.com): Making products that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Created with React, customized Bootstrap, and Firebase tools like Cloud Storage and Realtime DB, my portfolio includes dynamic post loading and a beautiful, responsive UI that reflects my love for front-end development.
